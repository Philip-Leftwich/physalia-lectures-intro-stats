# Reproducible Research {background-color="#D9DBDB"}

## What is Reproducibility?

## Introduction to Reproducible Research

![](images/reproducible-matrix.jpg){fig-align="center" fig-alt="Turing Way Community cc-by licence" width=80%}

- For Research to be reproducible both data and methods should be available.

- Applying the described methods to the data leads to the same results

## Methods

- In theory, method availability ≠ code

- But with complex data and analyses - are methods of data collection enough?

## Self-correcting Science?

- Science advances incrementally by identifying and rectifying errors over time

- Peer review: Critical evaluation of papers by experts maintain quality

- Independent studies either support or fail to replicate findings

## Self-correcting Science?

- Publication bias: preference for positive results

- Pressure to publish

- Poor study designs and statistical issues

- Lack of transparency


## Reproducibility trial: 

### 246 biologists get different results from same data sets

![](images/many-analysts.png){fig-align="center" fig-alt=": Forest plots of meta-analytic estimated standardized effect sizes (Zr, blue triangles) and their 95% confidence intervals for each effect size included in the meta-analysis model. (A) Blue tit analyses: Points where Zr are less than 0 indicate analyses that found a negative relationship between sibling number and nestling growth. (B) Eucalyptus analyses: Points where Zr are less than 0indicate a negative relationship between grass cover and Eucalyptus seedling success" width=80%}

## Reproducibility Crisis 

- The reproducibility crisis emerged when numerous studies, especially in fields like psychology, medicine, and biology, failed to be replicated by other researchers. 

- High-profile replication attempts revealed that many published results could not be consistently reproduced, raising doubts about their validity.

## Crisis as an Opportunity

- Recognition that no study should be considered 'definitive'

- Empower lasting systemic change through increased transparency in research methods, data sharing and reporting

- Structural change in academic culture


## Open Science

![](images/UNESCO-Open_science-pillars-en.png){fig-align="center" fig-alt="Open Science" width=70%}

Open science is a global movement that aims to make scientific research and its outcomes freely accessible to everyone. By fostering practices like data sharing and preregistration, open science not only accelerates scientific progress but also strengthens trust in research findings.

## UKRN

## Organised projects

- README

- Documented

- Easy to code with

- All files are inside the root folder

## R projects

![](images/Project.png){fig-align="center" fig-alt="R projects" width=70%}

## Slugs

- A string of characters defining a file

{{< fa hand-point-right >}} What do you think are the contents of these files:

- data/raw/madrid_minimum-temperature.csv

- scripts/02_compute_mean-temperature.R

- analysis/01_madrid_minimum-temperature_descriptive-statistics.qmd

## Name files

{{< fa hand-point-right >}} Come up with good names for these:

- a dataset of cats with columns for weight, length, tail length, fur colour(s), fur type and name.

- a script that downloads data from Spotify.

- a scripts that cleans up data.

- a scripts that fits a linear discriminant model and saves it to a file.

## R projects and clean slates

![](images/jenny_bryan.png){fig-align="center" fig-alt="R projects" width=100%}

- Use projects

- Check your code runs on blank slates

## Quarto
