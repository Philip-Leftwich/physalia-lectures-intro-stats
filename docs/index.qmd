# Reproducible Research {background-color="#D9DBDB"}

## What is Reproducibility?

## Introduction to Reproducible Research

![](images/reproducible-matrix.jpg){fig-align="center" fig-alt="Turing Way Community cc-by licence" width=50%}

- For Research to be reproducible both data and methods should be available.

- Applying the described methods to the data leads to the same results

## Methods

- In theory, method availability ≠ code

- But with complex data and analyses - are methods of data collection enough?

## Self-correcting Science?

- Science advances incrementally by identifying and rectifying errors over time

- Peer review: Critical evaluation of papers by experts maintain quality

- Independent studies either support or fail to replicate findings

## Self-correcting Science?

- Publication bias: preference for positive results

- Pressure to publish

- Poor study designs and statistical issues

- Lack of transparency


## Reproducibility trial: 

### 246 biologists get different results from same data sets

![](images/many-analysts.png){fig-align="center" fig-alt=": Forest plots of meta-analytic estimated standardized effect sizes (Zr, blue triangles) and their 95% confidence intervals for each effect size included in the meta-analysis model. (A) Blue tit analyses: Points where Zr are less than 0 indicate analyses that found a negative relationship between sibling number and nestling growth. (B) Eucalyptus analyses: Points where Zr are less than 0indicate a negative relationship between grass cover and Eucalyptus seedling success" width=50%}

## Reproducibility Crisis 

- The reproducibility crisis emerged when numerous studies, especially in fields like psychology, medicine, and biology, failed to be replicated by other researchers. 

- High-profile replication attempts revealed that many published results could not be consistently reproduced, raising doubts about their validity.

## Crisis as an Opportunity

- Recognition that no study should be considered 'definitive'

- Empower lasting systemic change through increased transparency in research methods, data sharing and reporting

- Structural change in academic culture


## Open Science

![](images/UNESCO-Open_science-pillars-en.png){fig-align="center" fig-alt="Open Science" width=50%}

Open science is a global movement that aims to make scientific research and its outcomes freely accessible to everyone. By fostering practices like data sharing and preregistration, open science not only accelerates scientific progress but also strengthens trust in research findings.

# Week Two: Descriptive Statistics  {background-color="#D9DBDB"}

## Building Statistical Models


::::{.columns}

:::{.column}

- What is a Statistical Model?

- A model is a simplified representation of real-world processes.

- It helps us describe, explain, and predict outcomes.

- A good fit makes accurate predictions; a poor fit can lead to misleading conclusions.

- To make reliable inferences, the model must accurately represent the data.

:::

:::{.column}

```{r, echo = FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("images/bridge.png")
```

> “Later, we'll see how models help us test hypotheses using p-values to assess if the data fits our expectations.”

:::

::::

## Populations and Samples

Population:

- The entire group you want to study (e.g., all humans, all mice in a lab).

- Studying the entire population is often impractical due to time, cost, or logistics.

Sample:

- A subset of the population, selected to make inferences about the whole.

- Must be representative to ensure accurate conclusions.



## Descriptive Statistics

- Summarize data to highlight key features:

- Central Tendency: Where is the "center" of the data? (mean, median, mode)

- Spread: How variable are the data? (variance, standard deviation)

- Helps us understand the data before making inferences.

## Central tendency

The **central tendency** of a series of observations is a measure of the “middle value”


The three most commonly reported measures of central tendency are the sample **mean, median, and mode**.


| Mean        | Median      | Mode       |
| ----------- | ----------- |----------- |
| The average value     | The middle value      |The most frequent value      |
| Sum of the total divided by *n*   | The middle value (if *n* is odd). The average of the two central values (if *n* is even)      |The most frequent value      |
| Most common reported measure, affected by outliers | Less influenced by outliers, improves as *n* increases | Less common




## Mean

One of the simplest statistical models in biology is the **mean**

::::{.columns}

:::{.column}

| Lecturer     | Friends |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Mark      | 5       |
| Tony   | 3     |
| Becky | 3    |
| Ellen   | 2      |
| Phil   | 1     |
| **Mean **  | **2.6**      |
| **Median **  | **3**      |
| **Mode **  | **3**      |


:::

:::{.column}


Calculating the mean:

$$ \bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n} $$
$$\frac{5 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1}{5} = 2.6$$

Sum all the values and divide by n of values

## The mean

One of the simplest statistical models in biology is the **mean**

::::{.columns}

:::{.column}


| Lecturer     | Friends |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Mark      | 5       |
| Tony   | 3     |
| Becky | 3    |
| Ellen   | 2      |
| Phil   | 1     |
| **Mean **  | **2.6**      |
| **Median **  | **3**      |
| **Mode **  | **3**      |


:::

:::{.column}

We already *know* this is a hypothetical value as you can't have 2.6 friends (I think?)

Now with any model we have to know how well it fits/ how accurate it is

:::

::::



## Symmetrical

If data is symmetrically distributed, the **mean and median** will be close, especially as *n* increases. 

This is also know as a **normal distribution**


```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "60%"}
# Load required packages
library(ggplot2)

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Generate random sample from a normal distribution
sample_size <- 1000
mu <- 0  # mean
sigma <- 1  # standard deviation
sample <- rnorm(sample_size, mean = mu, sd = sigma)

# Create a data frame with the sample data
df <- data.frame(x = sample)

# Create a histogram plot using ggplot2
ggplot(df, aes(x = x)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2, fill = "lightblue", color = "black") +
  labs(x = "Value", y = "Frequency", title = "Distribution Histogram") +
  theme_classic()


```


## Variance & Standard Deviation

Variance: 

The average of the squared differences from the mean.


$$s{^2}_{sample} = \frac{\sum(x - \bar{x})^2}{N -1}$$
Higher variance = more spread.

Standard Deviation (SD):

- The square root of variance.

- Easier to interpret because it’s in the same units as the data.

## Calculating variance

::::{.columns}

:::{.column}

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.alt = "Symmetrical sides"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/normal-distribution.jpg")
```

:::

:::{.column}



| Lecturer     | Friends | Residuals | Sq Resid |
| ----------- | ----------- |----------- |----------- |
| Mark      | 5       | 2.4 | 5.76 |
| Tony   | 3     | 0.4 | 0.16 |
| Becky | 3    | 0.4 | 0.16 |
| Ellen   | 2      | -0.6 | 0.36 |
| Phil   | 1     | -1.6 | 2.56 |
| **Mean **  | **2.6**      | | |




- Sum of Squared Residuals = 9

- N-1 = 4

- Variance = 9/4 = 2.25

:::

::::


## Standard Deviation

- Square root of **sample variance**

- A measure of dispersion of the sample

- Smaller SD = more values closer to mean, larger SD = greater data spread from mean

* *variance*:

$$
\sigma = \sqrt{\sum(x - \overline x)^2\over n - 1}
$$

## N-1? {.smaller}

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="30%", fig.alt = "Sampling"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/pop_sam.png")
```

For a *population* the variance $S_p^2$ is exactly the **mean** squared distance of the values from the population mean

$$
s{^2}_{pop} = \frac{\sum(x - \bar{x})^2}{N}
$$



But this is a *biased* estimate for the population variance 

- A biased sample variance will *underestimate* population variance

- n-1 (if you take a large enough sample size, will correct for this)

[More here](https://www.jamelsaadaoui.com/unbiased-estimator-for-population-variance-clearly-explained/#:~:text=The%20expected%20value%20of%20the%20sample%20variance%20is%20equal%20to,definition%20of%20an%20unbiased%20estimator.)

|  **Mean **  | **2.6**      |
| **variance** | **2.25** |
| **SD **  | **1.5**      |




## Standard Deviation

Small $s$ = data points are clustered near the mean

Large $s$ = data points are widely dispersed around the mean


```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, out.width = "60%"}

library(patchwork)

`SD = 1` <- rnorm(n = 1000, mean = 0, sd = 1)
`SD = 2` <- rnorm(n = 1000, mean = 0, sd = 2)
`SD = 3` <- rnorm(n = 1000, mean = 0, sd = 3)

tibble(`SD = 1`, `SD = 2`, `SD = 3`) %>% 
pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = "Standard Deviation", values_to = "values") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = values, fill = `Standard Deviation`))+
  geom_histogram()+
  facet_wrap(~ `Standard Deviation`)+
  theme_classic()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
  labs(x = " ",
       y = "Frequency")


```


## Why the Normal Distribution matters

Shape: Symmetrical, bell-shaped curve

- Described by just two parameters: mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ).

- Rule of Thumb: For normally distributed data:

    ~68% within 1 SD

    ~95% within 2 SDs

    ~99.7% within 3 SDs

> Relevance: Many statistical tests assume data follows a normal distribution. This helps us calculate probabilities—like p-values—to test hypotheses.

## Why the Normal Distribution matters

If we assume a normal distribution (or close enough), we can calculate the probability of observing any given value using just the mean and standard deviation. 

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi} \, \sigma}
       \exp\!\Biggl(-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\,\sigma^2}\Biggr)
$$

This has applications in hypothesis testing and building confidence intervals

## Z-Scores and the Standard Normal Distribution

Problem: Different datasets have different means and standard deviations.

Solution: Standardization allows comparisons by converting any normal distribution into a standard normal distribution (mean = 0, SD = 1).

$$
Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} 
$$

- Z: How many standard deviations a value is from the mean.

- X: Observed value.

- μ: Population mean.

- σ: Population standard deviation.

## Why do Z scores matter?

- The standard normal distribution allows us to calculate probabilities of observing extreme values.

- Example: If 𝑍 = 2, the observation is 2 standard deviations above the mean.

Using a Z-table, we can find the probability of getting a result at least this extreme.

This concept extends to p-values, which tell us how rare our data is under the null hypothesis.


# P-values

## What is a P-value?

:::{.incremental}

A p-value is the probability of obtaining results at least as extreme as the ones we observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true.



- It helps quantify how surprising or unusual our data is under the null hypothesis.


- A low p-value suggests that the observed data would be rare if the null hypothesis were true, which may lead us to question the null hypothesis

:::

#### Example

Imagine flipping a coin 100 times, expecting about 50 heads if it's fair (the null hypothesis). If you observe 90 heads, the p-value tells you how likely it is to get such an extreme result just by chance.

## Hypothesis formation

:::{.incremental}

- **Null hypothesis:** Assumes there is **no** difference between groups or no relationship between variables. It represents the "status quo" or baseline expectation.

> Example: A new drug has no effect compared to a placebo.


- **Alternative hypothesis:**  Assumes there **is** a difference or relationship.

> Example: The new drug does improve patient outcomes compared to the placebo.

:::

## Null Hypothesis Probability Distribution

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="50%"}

knitr::include_graphics("images/null_hypothesis.png")

```


- The shaded areas in the tails represent extreme outcomes (typically the most unexpected 5% if using an $\alpha$ = 0.05).

- If your observed data falls within these tails, it’s considered statistically significant, suggesting it’s unlikely to occur by random chance under the null hypothesis.


## Impact of Sample Size on Distributions

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="50%"}

knitr::include_graphics("images/null_5000.png")

```

- Key Point: Larger sample sizes reduce variability, making it easier to detect small differences as statistically significant.

- However, statistical significance doesn't always mean practical importance—especially with large samples.



## Hypothesis testing

:::{.incremental}

- **Scenario:** Testing if diet A and diet B affect mice longevity.

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** No difference in longevity between diets.

- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** There is a difference in longevity.


:::

```
lm(longevity ~ diet, data = mice)
```

Explanation: This linear model performs a t-test to assess if the mean lifespans differ significantly between diets.

```{r, echo = F}
data_sim <- function(mean1, mean2, sd){
set.seed(123)
mice_a <- rnorm(n = 12, mean = mean1, sd = sd)
mice_b <- rnorm(n = 12, mean = mean2, sd = sd)
mice <- data.frame(cbind(mice_a,mice_b)) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(),
               names_to = "diet",
               values_to = "longevity")

model <- lm(longevity ~ diet, data = mice)

tidy_model <- model %>% 
  broom::tidy(., conf.int =T)

tidy_model
}

tidy_model <- data_sim(mean1 = 4, mean2 = 3, sd =1)

```



## Visualising the T Distribution

::::{.columns}

:::{.column}

- The t-distribution shows where your observed mean difference falls relative to what’s expected under the null hypothesis.

- Confidence Intervals (CI): The red area marks the 95% CI. If zero falls outside this range, it suggests statistical significance.

```{r, fig.show="hold", out.width="50%", echo = F}

tidy_model

## Writing About Statistical Results

“Diets can change the longevity of mice (*p* = 0.0016).”

:::{.incremental}

- “Mice on diet B lived significantly shorter lives than mice on diet A (*t*<sub>22</sub> = -3.6, *p* = 0.006).”


- "Mice on diet B had a reduced mean lifespan of 1.41 years[95% CI; -0.595:-2.22] from the mice on diet A (mean 4.19 years (95% CI, 3.62-4.77). While statistically significant (*t*<sub>22</sub> = -3.6, *p* = 0.006), this is a relatively small sample size, and further testing is recommended to confirm this effect."

## Introduction to Standard Error

Standard error measures the accuracy of a sample mean as an estimate of the population mean.

$$
SE = {s\over \sqrt n}

## Standard Error

### Standard deviation vs. standard error: 


::::{.columns}

:::{.column}

- Standard deviation measures variability **within** a sample


$s = \sqrt{\sum(x - \overline x)^2\over n - 1}$

:::


:::{.column}

- Standard error  is how much the sample mean (from a given sample) is likely to vary from the true population mean.

$SE(\overline{X}) = \frac{s}{\sqrt(N)}$

:::

::::


## Standard Error

- Standard Error of the Mean ($\overline{X}$) is the **Standard Deviation of the Sampling Distribution of the Mean.

- If you took many samples of size 𝑛from the same population, each sample would yield a different sample mean.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.alt = ""}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sampling.png")
```

```{r, eval = F}

# install.packages("DiagrammeR")  # if not installed
library(DiagrammeR)

grViz("

    node [shape=circle, style=filled, color=lightblue];

  A [label=' Population mean \n 5'];
  B [label='1'];
  C [label='3'];

  E [label='4'];
  F [label='4'];

  A -> B A -> C A -> D A -> E A -> F A -> G A -> H A-> I A-> J A -> K A -> L A-> M A -> N A->O;
}
")


```


## Standard Error

- All these sample means form their own distribution: the sampling distribution of the mean.

- The Standard Error measures the width (standard deviation) of this distribution of sample means.

- Larger 𝑛→ smaller SE → sample means cluster more tightly around the true mean.

## Central Limit Theoreom (CLT)

- For large 𝑛the distribution of sample means becomes approximately normal, **no matter the original data’s shape** (assuming finite variance & independence).


- Lets us use normal-based methods (like confidence intervals and hypothesis tests) even if the original data are not normal—provided 𝑛 is large.


[Shiny App demonstrating CLT](https://pleft86.shinyapps.io/Sampling/)

## Small Samples

What is a sufficient 𝑛?

- When the data is very close to a normal distribution it might be very small c.10

- When the data is slightly skewed it might be 𝑛 = 30

- When the data follows an alternative distribution it could be very large


## Bootstrapping

- Bootstrapping: Resample from your data many times to estimate the distribution (and SE) of the Mean ($\overline{X}$) without assuming normality.

  # Resample with replacement
  resample <- sample(my_data, size = length(my_data), replace = TRUE)
  # Compute the statistic (mean here)
  boot_means[i] <- mean(resample)
}

## Parametric fits

If you *know* the data follows a specific distribution (e.g. Poisson, Binomial, etc) we can base our inference on these - *see Generalised Linear Models*

## Are two samples distributions from the same population?

- Even if two samples are both drawn from the same underlying population, they won’t have identical means.

- Question: When is that difference “big enough” to claim they come from different populations?

```{r, fig.width = 12}

plot_two_normals <- function(mean1 = 0, sd1 = 1, mean2 = 0.5, sd2 = 1) {
  x <- seq(-5, 5, by = 0.1)
  y1 <- dnorm(x, mean = mean1, sd = sd1)
  y2 <- dnorm(x, mean = mean2, sd = sd2)
  plot(x, y1, type = "l", col = "red", xlab = "X", ylab = "Density", main = "Two Normal Distributions")
  lines(x, y2, col = "blue", lty = "dashed")
  legend("topright", c("Population 1", "Population 2"), lty = c("solid", "dashed"), col = c("red", "blue"))
}

plot_two_normals()

```

## Standard Error vs. Standard Error of the Difference

::::{.columns}

:::{.column}


### Standard Error

Measures the spread (uncertainty) of one sample mean around its population mean.

### Standard Error of the Difference (SED)

$Mean~difference = \overline x_1 - \overline x_2$

$SED = \sqrt{s_1^2\over n_1}+{s_2^2\over n_2}$

Standard Error of the difference is calculated from two $s$ so will always be larger than a single population estimate

    sd <- sqrt(sd1^2/sample_size + sd2^2/sample_size)
    x <- seq(-5, 5, by = 0.1)
    mean_diff <- rnorm(10000, mean = mean2 - mean1, sd = sd)

## Two-sample t-tests

- Null Hypothesis : The two samples do not differ in their population means

- Alternative Hypothesis : The two samples come from populations with different means

**Even with identical populations, sample means differ. The t-test checks if that difference is too large to be due to chance.**

When can we determine that two sample means are different **enough**? To have come from *different* populations?

## Two-sample t-test

* Compare the means of two samples

* Null hypothesis: there is no difference between the population means

* t-statistic: based on difference in sample **means, sd & n**

* For a given sample size and t-value, how unlikely is to have two random samples *at least* this different IF both samples are drawn from identical/same populations. 


## T-test in Action

**Example:** A botanist is studying the mass of pollen transported by individual bees from two different hives (Hive A and Hive B). 

- Hive A: 62 bees, (mean pollen mass = 31.4 mg, variance = 225.0 mg^2) 

- Hive B: 67 bees, (mean pollen mass = 36.7 mg, variance = 186.0 mg^2) 


**Is there a significant difference in pollen mass transported per bee for the two hives studied?**


Variance $s^2$ = Sum of squared residuals/ n

Standard deviation (s) = $\sqrt Variance$


## Standard error of the difference

 **Calculate the difference in means, and the standard error of the difference in means**

## t-test in R

hive_data %>% 
  t_test(pollen_mass ~ hive,
         var.equal = T)

```

	Two Sample t-test

data:  hive_a and hive_b

t = 2.09, df = 127, p-value = 0.01152

alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0

95 percent confidence interval:
0.294166 10.30808

```

> We can also produce t-tests (and many other tests besides with the lm() function in R)

## Common misundertandings\n about P values

**A p-value is NOT:**

- The probability that the null hypothesis is true.

- The probability your results occurred "by chance."

- Proof of a meaningful or large effect.

**What it IS:**

- A measure of how surprising your data is under the assumption the null hypothesis is true.


[Common misconceptions about P-values](https://daniellakens.blogspot.com/2017/12/understanding-common-misconceptions.html?m=1)

[Evidence of P-hacking](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4359000/#:~:text=Evidence%20for%20p%2Dhacking%20from,test%20function%20in%20R)





## A non-significant p-value DOES NOT mean the null hypothesis is true

::::{.columns}

:::{.column}

In reality, we can’t know for sure if a true mean difference exists.

For illustration: Assume we could know the true mean difference.

The figure shows:

    Grey line: Expected data if the null hypothesis is true.

    Black line: Expected data if the alternative hypothesis is true.

A p-value shows how surprising the data are if the null is true.

A low p-value is evidence against the null, not proof of the alternative.

## Why a significant p-value does not mean the null hypothesis is false


What we can conclude, based on our data, is that we have observed an extreme outcome, that should be considered surprising. But such an outcome is not *impossible* when the null-hypothesis is true.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="60%"}

knitr::include_graphics("images/type-1.png")

```



## Why a significant p-value is not the same as an important effect

::::{.columns}

:::{.column}

If we plot the null model for a very large sample size, we can see that even very small mean differences will be considered 'surprising'. 

However, just because data is surprising, does not mean we need to care about it. It is mainly the verbal label ‘significant’ that causes confusion here – it is perhaps less confusing to think of a ‘significant’ effect as a ‘surprising’ effect.
